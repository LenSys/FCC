Request Header Parser Microservice
=============================================

Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to this: 
https://request-header-parser-microservice.freecodecamp.rocks/. 

Working on this project will involve you writing your code using one of the 
following methods:

* Clone this GitHub repo and complete your project locally.
* Use our Replit starter project to complete your project.
* Use a site builder of your choice to complete the project. Be sure to incorporate all 
  the files from our GitHub repo.

When you are done, make sure a working demo of your project is hosted somewhere public. 
Then submit the URL to it in the Solution Link field. Optionally, also submit a link to 
your project's source code in the GitHub Link field.
