Instructions
Follow the instructions and get all the user stories below to pass to finish the project.

You start with several files, one of them is games.csv. It contains a comma-separated list of all games of the final three rounds of the World Cup tournament since 2014; the titles are at the top. It includes the year of each game, the round of the game, the winner, their opponent, and the number of goals each team scored. You need to do three things for this project:

Part 1: Create the database

Log into the psql interactive terminal with psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=postgres and create your database structure according to the user stories below.

Don't forget to connect to the database after you create it.

Part 2: Insert the data

Complete the insert_data.sh script to correctly insert all the data from games.csv into the database. The file is started for you. Do not modify any of the code you start with. Using the PSQL variable defined, you can make database queries like this: $($PSQL "<query_here>"). The tests have a 20 second limit, so try to make your script efficient. The less you have to query the database, the faster it will be. You can empty the rows in the tables of your database with TRUNCATE TABLE games, teams;

Part 3: Query the database

Complete the empty echo commands in the queries.sh file to produce output that matches the expected_output.txt file. The file has some starter code, and the first query is completed for you. Use the PSQL variable defined to complete rest of the queries. Note that you need to have your database filled with the correct data from the script to get the correct results from your queries. Hint: Test your queries in the psql prompt first and then add them to the script file.

Notes:
If you leave your virtual machine, your database may not be saved. You can make a dump of it by entering pg_dump -cC --inserts -U freecodecamp worldcup > worldcup.sql in a bash terminal (not the psql one). It will save the commands to rebuild your database in worldcup.sql. The file will be located where the command was entered. If it's anything inside the project folder, the file will be saved in the VM. You can rebuild the database by entering psql -U postgres < worldcup.sql in a terminal where the .sql file is.

If you are saving your progress on freeCodeCamp.org, after getting all the tests to pass, follow the instructions above to save a dump of your database. Save the worldcup.sql file, as well as the final version of your insert_data.sh and queries.sh files, in a public repository and submit the URL to it on freeCodeCamp.org.
